# Neotron Pico

> A Neotron system powered by the Raspberry Pi Pico, in a micro-ATX form-factor.

The Neotron Pico is based around the idea of the [Neotron-32](https://github.com/neotron-compute/Neotron-32-Hardware), but using a low-cost Raspberry Pi Pico instead of a Texas Instuments Tiva-C Launchpad. It also stretches out to full micro-ATX size, and adds more expansion slots so that you can easily design and add your own peripherals.

## Design

The Raspberry Pi Pico is the core of the Neotron Pico. It uses PIO statemachines to generate 12-bit Super VGA video, and digital 16 bit 48 kHz stereo audio. It also has both I²C and SPI buses. SPI chipselects and IRQs are handled by an SPI-to-GPIO expander. This provides eight chip-selects and eight IRQs, to support up to eight expansion slots or peripherals. The eight chip-selects are gated with a tri-state bus transceiver, allowing the Pico to talk to either the I/O exander, or the selected expansion slot. The board has an SD Card fitted in the 'Slot 1' position, and the Board Management Controller in the 'Slot 0' position, leaving 'Slot 2' through to 'Slot 7' available for expansion. Each expansion slot has both I²C and SPI, along with unique chip-select and IRQ signals.

## Software

The Neotron Pico is designed to run the Neotron OS - a CP/M or MS-DOS alike OS written in Rust. But, being open-hardware, you can program your Neotron Pico to do pretty much anything.

### Super VGA output

The Raspberry Pi Silicon RP2040 generates 12-bit VGA video at a range of standard resolutions (including 640x480 @ 60 Hz).

* 15-pin D-Sub VGA interface
* 12-bit (4-4-4) RGB R2R DAC
* 3peak TPF133A or Texas Instruments THS7316 RGB video buffer
   * 36 MHz bandwidth - 1024x768@60Hz maximum
   * 6dB gain
   * Drives 75 ohm standard VGA interface
   * SOIC-8 package (1.27mm pitch)
* Texas Instruments TPD7S019 Sync/DDC level shifter and RGB EMC filter
   * SSOP-16 package (0.635mm pitch)

The design could easily be adapted to remove the TPF133A/THS7316 video buffer and the TPD7S019 level shifter/filter, and instead use the [1BitSquared DVI PMOD](https://1bitsquared.com/collections/fpga/products/pmod-digital-video-interface) board if you prefer a DVI output (using an HDMI connector).

Note that in the above table, the UART signals are wired as _Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)_.

This design should also be pin-compatible with the following SoCs (although the software may need recompiling):

* STM32F042K4Tx
* STM32F042K6Tx
* STM32L071KBTx
* STM32L071KZTx
* STM32L072KZTx
* STM32L081KZTx
* STM32L082KZTx

Note that not all STM32 pins are 5V-tolerant, and the PS/2 protocol is a 5V open-collector system, so ensure that whichever part you pick has 5V-tolerant pins (marked `FT` or `FTt` in the datasheet) for the PS/2 signals. All of the parts above _should_ be OK, but they haven't been tested. Let us know if you try one!

### PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse

* Kycon two-port stacked 6-pin DIN sockets (Kycon KMDGX-6S/6S-S4N)
* Controlled via Board Management Controller

### Power Supply

* 3A 5.0V main regulator (DC-DC switch-mode regulator module)
  * Morsun K7805-3AR3
* 30mA 3.3V stand-by regulator (a micropower linear regulator)
* 1A 3.3V regulator (a high-power 1117 type linear regulator)
* Controlled by the Board Management Controller

### I/O Expanders

Because we used so many pins on the Pico for Audio and Video, we don't have enough pins to use for _Chip Select_ lines. Each device we wish to communicate with on the SPI bus must have a unique chip select line and so have limited lines means we could only have a limited number of SPI devices.

However, in this design, we cheat and use a Microchip MCP23S17 I/O expander. This is an SPI peripheral with 16 GPIO pins that can be controlled by sending it commands over SPI. It also has an IRQ output which be programmed to fire when the input pins match a certain state.

The problem would come when the Pico has finished talking to our select SPI device - how does it tell the MCP23S17 to release the current chip select, without the SPI bus traffic also going to the currently selected expansion slot? We resolve this by using a simple 8-bit buffer with an enable pin. This allows the Pico to disconnect all of the chip select signals at once, regardless of the output of the MCP23S17. Once this is disabled, we know we are talking to only the MCP23S17 and the Pico can command it to select the next chip select of interest to us.

Interrupts are also processed through the MCP23S17. We configure the device to provide an IRQ (edge, active low) whenever any of the eight IRQ inputs are active (programmable for edge or level, active high/rising or low/falling). When the Pico receives an IRQ from the MCP23S17, it must do a read of the pins (using SPI) to find out which device actually raised the interrupt. This model is similar to that used in the IBM PC - where the Intel 8088 must talk to an Intel 8259A programmable interrupt controller over the ISA bus to find out which interrupt was raised - except that in our case, our CPU is very fast and our bus is pretty slow, so our interrupt latency isn't very good. Worse, if there is a big SPI transaction happening (such as transferring a 512 byte block from an SD card) when an interrupt fires, the Pico will have to wait for that to complete before it can talk to the MCP23S17 to handle the IRQ. That or it could just drop the SPI transaction mid-way through and re-try it later (if your expansion device can tolerate such rudeness).

## Expansion

The seven expansion sockets allow you to add on I²C or SPI based devices at a later date. Each provides a single chip-select and a single IRQ line - the motherboard design should ensure each socket gets a unique signal for each of these. Each expansion device should also contain a AT24C256 or similar EEPROM device. To allow these EEPROM devices to be scanned, each slot also contains three `EEPROM_ADDRESS` pins, tied to Vcc or GND in a unique combination. These should be connected through to the EEPROM address lines on your AT24C256, thus ensuring that each expansion card has its EEPROM at a unique address - 0x50 on Slot 0 through to a maximum possible 0x57 for Slot 7. Where your board has on-board devices, you should fit an AT24C256 EEPROM for each device so that the on-board devices can be discovered, exactly as if they were on an expansion card.

The expansion slot is a simple 2x10 header. We suggest the use of a TE card-edge connector, but you could equally use two 1x10 pin-headers if desired.

The expansion connector pinout is:

```
     SPI_COPI   1    2   GND
     SPI_CIPO   3    4   GND
      SPI_CLK   5    6   GND
      ~SPI_CS   7    8   ~IRQ
      I2C_SDA   9   10   I2C_SCL
 EEPROM_ADDR0   11  12   EEPROM_ADDR1
 EEPROM_ADDR2   13  14   ~RESET
           5V   15  16   5V
          3V3   17  18   3V3
          GND   19  20   GND
```

Four expansion slots line up with the ATX case expansion brackets, allowing you to use cards with external connectors. Note that these are aligned the "PCI way around" with components facing away from the board's I/O area, rather than the "ISA way around" which would have the components facing the I/O area. A further three of the expansion slots are available for internal use only.

### I²C Bus

All I²C device address given below are 7-bit values. The first byte in a message is the _control byte_; this is comprised of the device address in the top seven bits, and an extra bit at the bottom to indicate read (1) or write (0).

The memory addresses given are 8-bit values used to access the contents of an I²C device, and are usually supplied as the second byte in a message.

* Device Address 0x1A - TLV320AIC23
  * Memory Address 0x00 - Left line input channel volume control
  * Memory Address 0x01 - Right line input channel volume control
  * Memory Address 0x02 - Left channel headphone volume control
  * Memory Address 0x03 - Right channel headphone volume control
  * Memory Address 0x04 - Analog audio path control
  * Memory Address 0x05 - Digital audio path control
  * Memory Address 0x06 - Power down control
  * Memory Address 0x07 - Digital audio interface format
  * Memory Address 0x08 - Sample rate control
  * Memory Address 0x09 - Digital interface activation
  * Memory Address 0x0F - Reset register
* Device Address 0x50 - VGA Monitor (DDC)
  * Memory Addresses 0x00..0xFF - Monitor Specifications in [EDID format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data)
* Device Address 0x51 - Slot 1 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses 0x00..0xFF - Expansion Card Specification in NEID (Neotron Expansion ID) format
* Device Address 0x52 - Slot 2 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses as per Slot 1
* Device Address 0x53 - Slot 3 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses as per Slot 1
* Device Address 0x54 - Slot 4 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses as per Slot 1
* Device Address 0x55 - Slot 5 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses as per Slot 1
* Device Address 0x56 - Slot 6 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses as per Slot 1
* Device Address 0x57 - Slot 7 ID EEPROM
  * Memory Addresses as per Slot 1
* Device Address 0x6F - Real-time Clock
  * Memory Addresses 0x00..0x1F - Clock Configuration
  * Memory Addresses 0x20..0x5F - Battery-backed SRAM

## Expansion Ideas

Why not design and build your own expansion card? You could try designing:

* A dual Atari/SEGA 9-pin Joypad Interface
* A Mikro Electronika Click adaptor, allow many of the range of [Click boards](https://www.mikroe.com/click) to be fitted
* A Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card, using an Espressif ESP32
* A second processor card - perhaps with a RISC-V microcontroller, or classic Zilog Z80
* An OPL2 or OPL3 based FM synthesiser card
* An ISA adaptor card (taking an ISA card at right-angles, i.e. parallel to the base board) - a simple microcontroller should be able to bit-bang the ISA bus at 8 MHz and offer an SPI peripheral interface to the Neotron Expansion Slot
* An IDE interface card, allowing 40-pin IDE Hard Disk Drives and CD-ROM drives to be used - this will be quite similar to an ISA bus adaptor
* A floppy drive controller card - either using an eSPI Super I/O chip, or connecting a legacy ISA bus floppy controller as per the ISA adaptor
* A video card for a second monitor output, perhaps based on the CPLD used in the [VGAtonic](https://hackaday.io/project/6309-vga-graphics-over-spi-and-serial-vgatonic)
